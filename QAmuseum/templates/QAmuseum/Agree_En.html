    About This Project<br><div class="bordered">
    The goal of this project is to create opportunities for the general public to experience quantum computing technology. We aim to achieve this by developing a museum tour optimization application using an annealing machine (https://www.ipa.go.jp/jinzai/mitou/target/2023/gaiyou_ts-1.html). This project is conducted with the support of the Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan (IPA) Unexplored Target Project (https://www.ipa.go.jp/jinzai/mitou/target/index.html).
    ://www.ipa.go.jp/jinzai/mitou/target/2023/gaiyou_ts-1.html）。本プロジェクトは、情報処理推進機構（IPA）の未踏ターゲット事業（https://www.ipa.go.jp/jinzai/mitou/target/index.html）の支援を受けて実施されています。

    Application Terms of Use:
    <br><div class="bordered">
    This application is intended for the evaluation of a museum tour optimization application using an annealing machine. After using the application to tour a museum, users will be requested to respond to a survey for evaluation purposes. 
    <br>
    Please note the following when using the application:
    <br>
    • Data such as displayed routes and touring times collected by the application will be used for evaluation. However, we do not collect data other than the information entered into the application and the data displayed by the application.
    <br>
    • If you wish to discontinue the use of the application during the museum tour, you are free to do so.
    <br>
    • Use of the application for purposes other than touring a museum is strictly prohibited.
    <br>
    • Starting to use the application implies agreement to these terms of use.
